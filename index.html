                        <p>
                            This project is dedicated to the comprehensive statistical validation of the 21 cm cosmological signal model, as reported by the EDGES (Experiment to Detect the Global Epoch of Reionization Signature) radio telescope. The 21 cm signal is a crucial marker in the study of the early universe, potentially representing the first light emitted by the earliest stars and galaxies. The detection reported by EDGES suggests that this signal could offer profound insights into the formation of the universe, but such extraordinary claims require rigorous validation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The goal of this project is to apply advanced statistical methods to analyze the data associated with this signal, ensuring that the observed patterns are not the result of noise or other observational artifacts. By validating the model, we aim to confirm the authenticity and reliability of the signal, thereby contributing to our understanding of the early universe and the processes that shaped it. This involves the application of various statistical techniques, including hypothesis testing, model fitting, and uncertainty quantification, to assess the robustness of the findings.

                        <h2>ToDo Website - Task Management Platform</h2>
                        <p>
                            The ToDo Website is a task management platform created using React, designed to help users manage their daily activities and tasks efficiently. React was chosen for this project because of its ability to create a highly interactive platform that responds swiftly to user inputs. This makes the user experience seamless and engaging, as the platform dynamically updates in real-time based on user actions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The website allows users to search through their created tasks, add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks that have been finished. One of the key features of this ToDo app is the use of local storage. Local storage is leveraged to persist data on the client side, ensuring that tasks remain saved even when the browser is closed or refreshed. This means users can always return to their task list exactly as they left it, without losing any data.

                        <h2>Movie Website Development Using REST API and Web Technologies</h2>
                        <p>
                            This project is a part of the Platzi Advantage course, focusing on the development of a dynamic movie website. The project leverages the power of REST APIs, specifically the Movies API, which provides a rich database of films and series. The API allows developers to access a wide range of data, including movie details, genres, ratings, cast information, and more. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this project, we consume the public Movies API by using an API key and implementing user authentication through login on the movie website. This authentication enables personalized user experiences, such as saving favorite movies or tracking watch history. The project showcases the application of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to build a fully functional and interactive website.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The website includes features such as a search function to find specific movies or series, a detailed information page for each title, and a genre filter that allows users to explore content based on their preferences. Additionally, users can discover trending movies, watch trailers, and even read reviews. The responsive design ensures a seamless experience across devices, and the use of modern web development techniques provides a fast and engaging user interface.

                I am currently focused on expanding my skillset in Django, English, and Data Science through courses at Platzi. My goal is to become a well-rounded developer, capable of building full-stack applications and utilizing data to inform decisions. Learning Django will help me develop scalable and secure web applications, while improving my English will open up more opportunities in the global tech community. I am also diving into Data Science to gain deeper insights into data-driven problem solving, which is essential in today’s world. This combination of skills will allow me to lead innovative projects and contribute meaningfully to any tech team.
